# meals-of-the-week-app

School project during my education @Lexicon

## Task:

To build a web app that will help the user to create a weekly menu. 
The app has one page where the user can view and select meals to the menu. The user can also add new meals and remove those he/she doesn't want. It also has a button to add a random meal to the menu. 
The other page is the weekly menu where the user can remove one or all meals. 

The app also has the functionality to change between a ligth and dark theme.

## Tech used: 
VUE, VUEX, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
